    <p id="Page-Text">
        Cyber Champion is a fun and user friendly quiz-game to educate you on how to be cyber secure.
        <br>
        The questions are randomised for each difficulty and never duplicated/repeated for that set until you pass onto the next difficulty.
        <br>
        Whether the answer is right or wrong, you will always be prompted with a simple explanation of the correct answer.
        <br> <br>
        By answering timed questions correctly - you’ll get points!
        <br>
        If you answer them wrong - you'll lose hearts.

        This format is fun and engaging as it pushes you to try and get the most points as possible in order to beat your high score!

    <p id="Title">Additional Reading for Beginners</p>
    <p id="Page-Text">
        For some players who are new to the topic of Cyber Awareness, some of the questions might be quite difficult for beginners of this game. 
        <br>
        Therefore, here are a few sample questions and tips in order to make it easier :)
        <br> <br>
        Below is a question you may encounter while playing our game. 
        <br>

    <p id="Example-Question">
        Another example of an easy question would be - what is the best way to minimise your digital footprint?
    </p>

    <p id="Page-Text">
        A. Take fewer photos with your smartphone
        <br>
        B. Travel less with your smartphone
        <br>
        C. Post less on social media
        <br> <br>
        The answer to this would be - Post less on social media. 
        <br>
        This is because, if you don’t post a lot on social media then there won’t be many details of you on social media sites. 
        <br>
        Therefore, minimising your digital footprint.
        <br> <br>
    </p>

    <p id="Example-Question">
        An example of a medium question would be - which ride-sharing service collects the least amount of your data?
    </p>

    <p id="Page-Text">
        A. Uber
        <br>
        B. Lyft
        <br>
        C. Public Taxi Service
        <br> <br>
        The answer to this would be - Public Taxi Service.
        <br>
        This is because, Uber and lyft collect the data that you input into the app, although with a public taxi service, customers usually ring therefore 
        less information is being sent through to the company.
        <br> <br>
    </p>    

    <p id="Example-Question">
        An example of a difficult question would be - a group of computers that is networked together and used by hackers to steal information is called a...?
    </p>

    <p id="Page-Text">
        A. Botnet
        <br>
        B. Rootkit
        <br>
        C. DDoS
        <br>
        D. Operating System
        <br> <br>
        The answer to this would be a Botnet.
